 * points	                    Floating point number.
 * penalty	                    Integer. Penalty (in ICPC meaning) of the party for this problem.
 * rejectedAttemptCount         Integer. Number of incorrect submissions.
 * type                         Enum: PRELIMINARY, FINAL. If type is PRELIMINARY then points can decrease (if, for example, solution will fail during system test). Otherwise, party can only increase points for this problem by submitting better solutions.
 * bestSubmissionTimeSeconds    Integer. Number of seconds after the start of the contest before the submission, that brought maximal amount of points for this problem.
